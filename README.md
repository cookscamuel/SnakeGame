### Snake Game

This project features a modified version of the classic game Snake.
The code for the base Snake game was created by [Bro Code](https://www.youtube.com/@BroCodez), a YouTube
tutorial for his code can be found
[here.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bI6e6qjJ8JQ&ab_channel=BroCode) You can find a singleplayer version
with high score tracking that allows for initial entry, and a multiplayer version that allows for a weird
co-op version of Snake.
